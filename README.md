# social-backend-api

  ## Description

  I have created the back end for a basic social media platform, much like a twitter or other applications. You will be able to create a user, from there you are able to posts thoughts, and even react to someones thought. There is full CRUD funcationallity in this application, with each user, thought, and reaction (reactions can only be created and deleted, just like twitter *smile*).
